Start Location: {{{currentLocation}}}
Destination: {{{destination}}}

Generate the following:
1.  **Two safe routes**: These should have 'low' or 'medium' congestion. Give them plausible names relevant to Nashik (e.g., "Via Gangapur Road", "Trimbak Road Bypass", "Panchavati Link Road"). Create a simple, fictional path of 5-10 latitude/longitude points for each that looks like a real route. Estimate a travel time.
2.  **One congested route**: This should have 'high' congestion. Give it a plausible name (e.g., "Main Road through Ram Ghat"). Create a simple, fictional path of 5-10 points. Estimate a longer travel time.
3.  **Recommendation Reasoning**: Write a short paragraph explaining that the routes are generated based on a simulation and that the recommended routes are chosen to avoid delays.

For the coordinates, create a logical but fictional path. For example, if moving from south to north, the latitude should generally increase. The path should look like a plausible road on a map (e.g., gentle curves, not random points).
