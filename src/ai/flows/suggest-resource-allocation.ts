Current Hotspots Data:
{{{hotspots}}}

Analyze the hotspot data, paying close attention to areas with 'high' or 'critical' severity.

Provide specific, actionable recommendations for deploying resources:
1.  **Security Teams:** Suggest where to position or move security personnel to manage crowd flow, prevent congestion, and maintain order. Prioritize the most critical areas. Suggest moving teams from low-density areas if necessary.
2.  **Medical Teams:** Suggest where to station medical teams to ensure quick response times to potential incidents. They should be near, but not inside, the most crowded areas to maintain access.
3.  **Reasoning:** Briefly explain the logic behind your recommendations (e.g., "Focusing resources on the Main Stage due to critical density and redirecting from the less crowded Restrooms area.").

Assume we have 5 security teams and 3 medical teams available for deployment.
